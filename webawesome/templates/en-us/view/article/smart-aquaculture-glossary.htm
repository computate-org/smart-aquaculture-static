            <h4>Cluster</h4>
            A cluster is a group of computers (called nodes) that work together as a single system.
            In Kubernetes or OpenShift:
                • The cluster includes a control plane (master) and worker nodes.
                • The control plane manages everything.
                • The worker nodes run the applications (containers, pods, etc.).
             In simple words:
            A cluster = a team of computers working together to run and manage applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Concept</h4>
            When you install OpenShift Local (crc) on your computer:
                • It creates and runs a virtual machine (VM) inside your computer.
                • That VM contains a mini OpenShift cluster — basically, a small, single-node version of OpenShift.
                • You can then use this local OpenShift environment to develop, test, and deploy applications, just like in a real OpenShift cloud setup.
